# Simple OSPF lab using FRR

This lab example consists of three FRR routers connected in a ring topology. Each router has one PC connected to it.

This is also an example of how to pre-configure lab nodes on "linux" node types in Containerlab.

To start this lab, run the *run.sh* script, which will run the containerlab deploy commands, and then configure the PC interfaces.

The lab configuration is documented in detail at: https://www.brianlinkletter.com/2021/05/use-containerlab-to-emulate-open-source-routers/
